# 👋 Hi, I’m Krina — I turn coffee and code into mobile apps!

📱 React Native Developer | 💻 B.Tech CSE @ Indus University  
🎓 BS Data Science @ IIT Madras | ⚙️ UI Lover + State Manager + API Whisperer

## 🚧 What I’m Building (and occasionally breaking 😅)

🛒 **StickyShop – Notes & Cart App**  
Redux Toolkit + redux-persist magic with clean UI & full CRUD flow  
*React Native • Redux Toolkit • AsyncStorage*

🌦️ **Weather App**  
Minimal yet aesthetic weather UI with real-time API + dynamic gradients  
*React Native • REST API • Gradient Backgrounds*

🧮 **YouTube Analytics Dashboard** *(Data never sleeps)*  
Because plotting graphs is also fun when not debugging styles  
*Power BI • Pandas • SQL*

## 🧰 Toolbox of Wonders

**Mobile & Frontend**:  
`React Native` · `Redux Toolkit` · `Expo` · `JavaScript` · `Navigation` · `AsyncStorage`

**Data (My Secret Power) 💾**:  
`Python` · `SQL` · `Power BI` · `Pandas` · `PostgreSQL`

**Dev Tools**:  
`VS Code` · `GitHub` · `npm/yarn` · `Metro Debugger` · `Figma (sometimes 😬)`

## 🎯 What I Do (Other Than Hunt Bugs)

- Build smooth mobile UIs that users don’t want to uninstall  
- Architect state like a backend engineer (thanks, Redux!)  
- Integrate APIs like a pro without breaking the internet  
- Debug layout issues with intense squinting + prayer  
- Occasionally analyze data because I still love charts ❤️

## 😄 Fun Facts

- Dark mode enthusiast 🌚  
- Proud member of the `console.log()` debugging squad  
- Currently working on: better animations, smoother state, and remembering semicolons  
- Motto: *“If it works on my phone, it’s good enough.”*

👀 **Currently looking for React Native/Data analyst internships** where I can turn wireframes into wonders!
