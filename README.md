## 🛠️ What I'm Building (Besides My Career)

🧩 **Sparkify ETL Pipeline**  
Extracts, Transforms, Loads — like a wizard but for music data 🎶  
*PostgreSQL + Python + Star Schema ✨*

🛍️ **E-Commerce Data Pipeline**  
Turning Parquet files into pretty tables you actually want to query  
*Snowflake + Pandas + a lot of `.head()` and `.describe()`*

📹 **YouTube Engagement Analytics**  
Cracked the code on what people binge-watch and why  
*SQLite + Pandas + CSV export for the win*
